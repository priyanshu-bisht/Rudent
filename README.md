# 🙊 __Rudent__ (Rude or Not?)
- A lot of times we don't check or just don't realise that we are being rude to someone through our words. So this is a fun Project I made which can classify if a text is _Rude or Not_.
- This Project is built using a custom tokenizer that I implimented from scartch and Tensorflow-Keras for classification model.

# 📦 __Prerequisites__
- Sentiment140 [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140)

# 💽 __Models__
- __rudent__ - Classification Model
- __tokenizer__ - Tokenizer

# 🌊 __Flow__
- Make a Padded Sequence from the sentence using Tokenizer
- Classify that Padded Sequence using the rudent model.
